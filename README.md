# Assignment
Here is my assignment for a data analytics internship at TROP ICSU.I have developed the K-NN regression model in python using Spyder IDE and the data visualizations have been plotted in spyder IDE too.
As we can see by the elbow curve for a very low value of k (suppose k=1), the model overfits on the training data, which leads to a high error rate on the validation set. On the other hand, for a high value of k, the model performs poorly on both train and validation set. If you observe closely, the validation error curve reaches a minima at a value of k = 2. The value of k that is the optimum value of the model found by using grid search technique to determine the best K value which is 5.. This curve is known as an ‘elbow curve‘ (because it has a shape like an elbow) and is usually used to determine the k value.
By using pred variable , we can see the predicted values for total rainfall from june to september. By getting the root mean square error values(rmse) for test set of y we can  then plot the validation curve and see the elbow curve and see optimum value of K.
Same can be done for training set by calculation the root mean square error values for the predictions it makes and comparing it with observed values then plotting a curve for the rmse values against K values.
Also by checking the r squared value at the end of the model we can see how good a fit the model is for the given dataset.
